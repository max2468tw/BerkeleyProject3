# Project 3
<br>
This is my third project from Summer 2016 at UC Berkeley.  The prompt can be found <a href = "http://www.cs61bl.org/su16/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html">here</a>.
This was a joint project between myself and another student named Hong Shuo Chen.  His github
can be found <a href = "https://github.com/max2468tw">here</a>.  Skeleton code was provided to us,
mostly related to the JavaSpark Framework.  The focus of this project was on data structure usage and runtime efficiency. My work was focused on the implementation and usage of a Tree variant, a QuadTree, as well as the the search feature, requiring a Trie implementation, in addition to handling the map redrawing required for pathing.
<br><br>
There are other files, not included for cleanliness, required to make this work.  If you'd like to demo the project, let me know and I 
can send you instructions on how to set it up.

Note that at the time of completion, I was a Junior in high school.
