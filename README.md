#Project 3
This is my third project from Summer 2016 at UC Berkeley.  The prompt can be found <a href = "http://www.cs61bl.org/su16/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html">here</a>.
This was a joint project between myself and a Chinese University student named Hong Shuo Chen.  His github
can be found <a href = "https://github.com/max2468tw">here</a>.  A significant amount of skeleton code was provided to us,
mostly related to the JavaSpark Framework.  The focus of this project was on data structure usage and time efficiency.
Thanks for taking a look :D

There are other files, not included for cleanliness, required to make this work.  If you'd like to demo the project, let me know and I 
can send you instructions on how to set it up.
